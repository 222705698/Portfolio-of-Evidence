### üéØ My Reflection (STAR Technique)

**SITUATION**  
As I prepared for entry-level software engineering interviews, I realized that success required both theoretical knowledge and practical preparation. I needed to demonstrate both my technical competence and my ability to communicate effectively with potential employers. Additionally, understanding the companies I was applying to was essential for tailoring my responses and showing genuine interest.

**TASK**  
My goal was to create a document for interview readiness through theoretical assessment, structured question preparation, practicing technical and behavioral questions, and performing in-depth company research. I wanted to ensure that I could confidently present my skills, connect my experience to the companies' needs, and ask meaningful questions during interviews.

**ACTION**  
To achieve this, I:
- Researched common technical and behavioral interview questions, applying the STAR technique to provide structured answers with real-life examples
- Conducted detailed company research to understand tech stacks, values, culture, and growth opportunities
- Prepared thoughtful questions tailored to each company, demonstrating both curiosity and industry awareness
- Practiced articulating my technical projects to show practical experience relevant to employer needs

**RESULT**  
Through this process, I:
- Gained confidence in answering interview questions and presenting my skills
- Learned to tell specific, structured stories that highlight my problem-solving, teamwork, and technical abilities
- Understood that interviews are two-way conversations, where evaluating company culture and growth opportunities is just as important as presenting myself
- Recognized the value of preparation and research, which reduces anxiety, improves focus, and allows me to respond to questions thoughtfully

### üí° Key Lessons Learned
