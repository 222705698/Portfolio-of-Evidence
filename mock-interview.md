**ACTION**  
To prepare and perform effectively, I:
- Researched common software engineering interview questions and practiced responses
- Prepared examples of my projects using the STAR technique
- Set up recording equipment to capture both audio and video for review
- Maintained professional appearance and body language throughout
- Applied active listening skills to understand each question fully before responding
- Asked thoughtful questions about the company and role when given the opportunity

**RESULT**  
The mock interview provided valuable insights and outcomes:
- Received positive feedback on my technical knowledge and project explanations
- Identified areas for improvement in conciseness and time management
- Gained confidence in handling unexpected or challenging questions
- Learned to balance technical detail with clear, accessible explanations
- Improved my ability to stay calm and focused under interview pressure

### üí° Key Lessons Learned
